#1 There is a built-in vector LETTERS contains the uppercase letters of the alphabet and letters which contains the lowercase letters of the alphabet.

UppercaseLetter <- LETTERS [1:26]
UppercaseLetter

LowercaseLetter <- letters [1:26]
LowercaseLetter

#a. You need to produce a vector that contains the first 11 letters.
first_11_letters <- LETTERS[1:11]
first_11_letters

#b. Produce a vector that contains the odd numbered letters.
oddnumber <- LETTERS[c(TRUE, FALSE)]
oddnumber

#c. Produce a vector that contains the vowels


vowels <- LETTERS[c(1, 5, 9, 15, 21)]
vowels

#d. Produce a vector that contains the last 5 lowercase letters.

LowerCaseLetter <-  letters [22:26]
LowerCaseLetter

#e. Produce a vector that contains letters between 15 to 24 letters in lowercase.

LowerCaseLetter <- letters  [c(15:24)]
LowerCaseLetter

#2. Create a vector(not a dataframe) with the average temperatures in April for Tugue- garao City, Manila, Iloilo City, Tacloban, Samal Island, and Davao City. The average temperatures in Celcius are 42, 39, 34, 34, 30, and 27 degrees.




#2a. What is the R code and its result for creating a character vector for the city/town of Tuguegarao City, Manila, Iloilo City, Tacloban,Samal Island, and Davao City? Name the object as city. The names should follow the same order as in the instruction.

average_city <- c("Tuguegarao City", "Manila", "Iloilo City", "Tacloban", "Samal Island", "Davao City")

average_city



#Output  "Tuguegarao City" "Manila" "Iloilo City"  "Tacloban"    "Samal Island" "Davao City

#2b. The average temperatures in Celcius are 42, 39, 34, 34, 30, and 27 degrees. Name the object as temp. Write the R code and its output. Numbers should also follow what is in the instruction.

average_temperatures <- c(42, 39, 34, 34, 30, 27)
average_temperatures

#output "42" "39" "34" "34" "30" "27"

#2c. Create a dataframe to combine the city and the temp by using â€˜data.frame(). What the R code and its result?

#the result it shows the City and the Temperature Celcius 

city_temp <- data.frame(City = city, Temperature = temp)
